# Motivation
This is a random collection of all my small side projects. 

Contents:

- Scraping.ipynb is how I scraped the comments from trustpilot of a product using BeautifulSoup in Python.
- Google_ML_dataset.ipynb is a deep learning neutral network model training practice. The dataset is taken from the Google ML "Intro to Fairness" >> Programming Exercise.
- Text_Processing.ipynb is a little collection of text cleaning techniques in preparation for NLP and sentiment analysis.
- geomap.ipynb makes a choreopleth map using geopandas, pandas and matplotlib.
- random_forest_regression is a simplified walk-through of how random forest regression works.
- CAC&CLTV is an example project inspired by Tony Yiu on simulating market campaigns and customer lifetime value.
- Python selenium is a powerful tool for performing automation testing, hence automating_testing.ipynb is an example of how we can make user selenium to mimic user journey and performa testing.
- Visualize_a_decision_tree.ipynb is to show how one can create a visualization of decision tree with pydotplus and graphviz.
- Forecast-Copy1.ipynb uses ARIMA for time series data in pandas to predict future sales. 
- ARIMA(no_seasonality) merely for documentation's sake. Credit all to medium post mentioned in the file. An attempt I made based on the dataset I had at hand with auto_arima: see <auto_arima.ipynb>.
