# Motivation
This is a random collection of all my small side projects. 

Contents:

- Scraping is how I scraped the comments from trustpilot of a product using BeautifulSoup in Python.
- Google_ML_dataset is a deep learning neutral network model. The dataset is taken from the Google ML "Intro to Fairness" >> Programming Exercise.
